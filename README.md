ÔºÉGuitar Practise Randomization in Lua

This is a simple **obsolete** random guitar exercise generator written in lua.

This generator is done mostly by randomizing strings, which is inefficient and uneffective when dealing with more advanced concept, especially things involving voicing and actual playbacks.


I am currently working on a *more elaborated*, *object-oriented* version which will be published in APP form.
